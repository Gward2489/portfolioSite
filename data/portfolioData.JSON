        "bioOne": " As someone who has always enjoyed working with a craft, software development was naturally appealing to me. Coming from a background of repairing, modifying, and building guitars I adapted naturally to designing software. I was immediantly drawn to programming because it required creative problem solving, much like repairing and modifying guitars. However, I quickly found I had a passion for the aspects of programming that have to relation to music.",
        "bioTwo": " Upon attending Nashville Software School, I found the world of object oriented programming was very foreign and confusing, but I quickly became fascinated by it. I found myself reading more about the material I was learing in school at home, and often into the early hours of the morning. As I come to a close finishing my education at Nashville Software School, I am excited by the oppurtunity to develop my new craft in the years to come, and to continue to learn new fun and engaging technologies as they emerge."
